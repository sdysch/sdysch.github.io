# Hello!
![face](./images/me.png){:style="display: block; width: 200px; height:auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right:40px; float: left;"}

I'm Sam, a postdoctoral research associate at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I work on the [ATLAS experiment](https://atlas.cern/") at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) (LHC), [CERN](https://home.cern/").

Previously, I was a PhD student at [The University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).
My [thesis](./thesis) topic involved understanding the identification of [tau leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_(particle)) in ATLAS,
including testing their [universality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton#Universality) in W boson decays.
